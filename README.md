## Descrption

This is a simulation of T-cell activation model, in which the activation is probabilistically determined by the count of the individual LAT condensates.
By discovering how the T-cell experiences the LAT condensate formations and how the information embedded is transferred to activation decision, we hope to gain a holistic picture of how a T-cell is able to selectively yet sensitively activate when detecting only small counts of long-dwelling ligands embedded in the plethora of short-dwelling ligands.
